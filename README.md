# Kaggle_Predict_House_Price
Kaggle ML Competition based on predicting House Prices based on Advanced Regression Techniques. </br >
## Problem Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.</br>

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.</br>
